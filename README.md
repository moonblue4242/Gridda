# Gridda
Gridda is a window positioning tool for Windows 10. Windows can be snapped to self defined grid lines and span one ore more grid tiles.

This tool does not utilize the mouse to position the windows but relies solely on keyboard shortcuts.

Gridda is configured via a simple YAML-formatted config file located inside the program directory and can be accessed via a notification icon in the system tray.
